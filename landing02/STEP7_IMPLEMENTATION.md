# Step 7 and Intermediate Keto Info Page Implementation

## Overview
Added Step 7 (Keto knowledge question) and an intermediate informational page that appears between Step 6 and Step 7.

## Changes Made

    - Mental health benefits
  - "Continue" button to proceed to Step 7

#### Step 7 - Keto Knowledge
- Question: "Have you heard about the Keto meal plan?"
- Three options with emojis:
  1. "Nothing at all" ðŸ¤”
  2. "I've heard a thing or two" ðŸ™‹
  3. "I'm an experienced faster" ðŸ˜Ž
- Identical for both male and female users

### 2. CSS Styling (`quiz-styles.css`)

#### Intermediate Page Styles

#### Modified Functions

   - Dynamically hides/shows step counter based on page type

2. **`goToNextStep()`**
   - After Step 6, shows intermediate page instead of going directly to Step 7
   - Prevents step counter from incrementing for intermediate page

3. **`goToPreviousStep()`**
   - Handles back navigation from intermediate page to Step 6
