# Step 10 Implementation - Water Intake

## Overview
Added Step 10 with the question "How much water do you drink daily?" with five water intake options and a manual continue button.

## Changes Made

### 1. HTML Structure (`quiz.html`)

#### Step 10 - Water Intake
- Question: "How much water do you drink daily?"
- Five options with icons and descriptions:
  1. "Less than 0.5 L üíß" - Fewer than 2 glasses
  2. "0.5 - 1.5 L üíßüíß" - 2-6 glasses
  3. "1.5 - 2.5 L üíßüíßüíß" - 7-10 glasses
  4. "More than 2.5 L üö∞" - More than 10 glasses
  5. "Don't count ‚Äî it depends ü§∑" (shown as selected in screenshot)
- **Continue button** appears after selection
- Identical for both male and female users

### 2. CSS Styling (`quiz-styles.css`)

#### Step 10 Styles
- `.water-intake-selection` - Container with flex column layout
- `.water-intake-options` - Vertical flex layout with 12px gap, max-width 500px
- `.water-intake-option` - Clickable card with hover effect
- `.water-intake-content` - Flex layout
  - Padding: 16px 20px
  - Background: light gray (#F5F5F5)
  - Border: 2px solid transparent
  - Border-radius: 12px

  - White background
  - Teal border (--color-primary)
  - Box shadow for emphasis
- `.water-intake-text-container` - Flex column for text and subtext
- `.water-intake-text` - 16px font, medium weight (main text with emoji)

- `.water-continue-btn` - Full-width teal button (like intermediate page)
  - Max-width: 500px
  - Padding: 16px 24px
  - Hidden by default, shown after selection

#### Responsive Styles (Mobile)

### 3. JavaScript Logic (`quiz-script.js`)

#### Updated Step Count
- Changed `totalSteps` from 9 to 10
- Updated HTML step counter from 9 to 10

#### New Function
**`initWaterIntakeSelection()`**
- Handles Step 10 option selection
- Removes selection from all options
- Adds selection to clicked option
- Stores selection in `quizData.waterIntake`
- **Shows continue button** after selection
- Continue button advances to next step after 300ms

#### Modified Functions
1. **`attachEventListeners()`**
   - Added Step 10 initialization call

2. **`validateCurrentStep()`**
   - Added validation for Step 10 (case 10)
   - Returns true if `quizData.waterIntake` is defined

3. **Validation Alert Messages**
   - Added alert for Step 10: "Please select your water intake to continue."

## Data Structure
```javascript
quizData = {
    gender: 'male' | 'female',
    goal: string,
    build: string,
    dreamBody: string,
    targetZones: array,
    bestShapeTimePeriod: string,
    ketoKnowledge: 'nothing' | 'heard-some' | 'experienced',
    typicalDay: 'sitting' | 'active-breaks' | 'on-feet',
    sleepHours: 'less-than-5' | '5-6' | '7-8' | 'more-than-8',
    waterIntake: 'less-than-0.5' | '0.5-1.5' | '1.5-2.5' | 'more-than-2.5' | 'dont-count'
}
```

```

## Key Differences from Other Steps

### Manual Continue Button
Unlike other steps that auto-advance, Step 10 has a **Continue button**:
- Button is hidden by default (`display: none`)
- Button appears after user makes a selection
- User must click "Continue" to proceed
- This matches the screenshot design

### Two-Line Text Format
Each option (except last) has:
- **Main text**: Volume range with water emoji
- **Subtext**: Glass count in lighter color

‚úÖ Water emoji indicators (üíß üö∞ ü§∑)  
‚úÖ Two-line format with main text + subtext  
‚úÖ Same for both genders
